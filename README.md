# FEND | Arcade Game
A Frogger Arcade Game built with Vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries. It is all about crossing the bugs and reach to the `Water` to get some points, and try not to touch a Bug!

## How to Play?
- Open the [Live Preview](https://elharony.github.io/FEND-Arcade-Game/)
_If you want to run the game locally, `Download` the `Project` Files, and open the `index.html` file!_
- Change your `Character` by clicking on one of the available ones
- Try to reach the `Water` without touching a `bug`

> It is a Keyboard Game **only**. You can control it with the arrows `up`, `down`, `right`, `left`

## Game Rules
- You have 3 lives, by touching any `bug`, you will lose one live
- Reaching the `Water` increase your `score` by `20` points

_There is no task to win, it is all about getting a high score, and brag about it!_
